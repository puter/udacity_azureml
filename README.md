# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure - Chad Puterbaugh

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This dataset contains marketing information for prospective customers. We seek to predict whether the customer will respond to a marketing campaign.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
Using hyperdrive, the best performing model 

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
The pipeline archecture was to create and register a tabular dataset from a url. That dataset was then converted into a pandas dataframe. The dataframe was 

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
Exploring max_iter allowed the model to determine the ballpark iterations needed for the algorithm to converge on correct weights
**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
The best performing model was a Voting Ensemble model with accuracy of .918. The component models were XGBoost Classifier, SGD, and LightGBM, sometimes represented multiple times with differing parameters. 
## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
